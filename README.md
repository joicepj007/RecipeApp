About


MVP(Model View Presenter) is the architecture pattern used in this project.

It provides modularity, testability and, in general, a more clean and maintainable codebase.

Advantages of MVP

 1.Clear separation of responsibilities between components.
    This separation allows for an easier understanding and maintenance of the code 
     base.
     
2. Modularity allows us to e.g. switch to a different implementation of view
    component in order to completely change application's UI, while all other  
    components remain intact.
    
3. Easier testing. Since there are well defined boundaries between components, it
    becomes much easier to test each component in isolation (by e.g. mocking other 
    components).

Library Used:

Retrofit,rxjava,Recyclerview,Mockito etc

3rd party Libraries not Used.
